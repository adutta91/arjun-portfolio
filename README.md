# Arjun Dutta Portfolio

A site for my personal portfolio. Built with ReactJS and a simple Express backend it features some of my custom-built components, as well as provides links to my github, linkedin, and resume.

As always, while the portfolio is released and ready, there are a few things I still want to achieve. Below are some goals to make this portfolio even better. Also, if you have any feedback, critiques, or questions - or better yet, you want to work together on a side project (of which I have several in my back pocket that I've been meaning to work on), please reach out to me!

  - add more projects to the project list
    - there are a bunch of projects I've been involved in that aren't represented on the website. I'd like to go through and see which ones I'd be comfortable adding (given client confidentiality, permission, etc)
